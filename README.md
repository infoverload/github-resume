This application uses the GitHub API and allows a user to generate a resume from their GitHub account statistics.
There is an option to download the result into a PDF. The W3.CSS framework was chosen for the Frontend and JSPDF was used for PDF functionality. 

A hosted version can be found at http://github-resume.appspot.com

Since it is still a work in progress, some future considerations include: 
- better mobile responsiveness
- more polished and aesthetic-pleasing PDF printout
- option to alter the colour/aesthetics of the generated resume
- more statistics and information displayed
- OAuth for authorization to increase API limit and get more statistics
- better error handling
